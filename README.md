**Interactive Love Game üíñ**

This is a fun and interactive, responsive web game designed to bring a smile to your face! ü•∞

Here's what it does:

**Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across devices, from desktops to mobile.

**Playful NO Button:** The NO button is mischievous and moves away randomly whenever you try to hover over or tap it, making it impossible to click!

**YES Button Reaction:** Once you click the YES button, a heartfelt message saying "I love you too!" pops up on the screen.

**Floating Heart Animation:** To add more love, a delightful floating heart animation starts, making the moment extra special. üíï

Perfect for showcasing interactivity, responsiveness, and dynamic animations using modern web technologies.
